In this project we will study a reinforcement learning AI that plays tic-tac-toe ss the first player. We will take advantage of the isomorphism between the tic-tac-toe board-states
and the 3x3 magic square

| 2 | 7 | 6 |

| 9 | 5 | 1 |

| 4 | 3 | 8 |

Chosing an square in tic-tac-toe is equivalent to chosing a number from 1 to 9. A player win when they have chosen 3 numbers that add up to 15.
